# CSCI495-C3

## Description / Purpose
I have recently learned a new way to position things in CSS/SASS which is FlexBox insead of using floats, and other complicated things. So for this project I worked on a flex box project which again was just front end. The product is what could be a a real site for booking hotels, flights, trips, and more. However, what I really wanted to do was look at the enout of code it took to code up and how long it really could have been without the flexbox. 


## Dependencies
devDependencies:
    autoprefixer: 9.6.1,
    concat: 1.0.3,
    node-sass: 4.12.0,
    npm-run-all: 4.1.5,
    postcss-cli: 6.1.3

## Usage
The usage of this is the abilty to be coded with minimal lines and the abliity to show some new animations and transitions. 

## Future Work
This could be a working site if i were to set this us with some Node Server and create an actual functioning website for users, flrights to be booked, and more using Node, React, and Java/C/or quite possibly PHP. 

## What is your major and how this project is related to your major.
I am a computer information systems major and we have learned quite a bit about webdevelopment but not as much as I have learened and am currently learning on my own. We havent really touched SASS or CSS for the most part and especially not Flex Box so I really wanted to highlight the ability that Flex Box could do on the amount of code that needed to be created to make up a page like this.
